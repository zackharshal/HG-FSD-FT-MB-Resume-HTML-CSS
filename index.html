                    The project "Single Image Shadow Detection and Removal" is a MATLAB-based application that aims to automatically 
                    detect and remove shadows from a single image. By combining MATLAB's powerful image processing capabilities with 
                    a user-friendly GUI, the "Single Image Shadow Detection and Removal" project provides a convenient tool for users 
                    to automatically detect and remove shadows from their images. This project can find applications in various domains, 
                    including photography, image editing, and computer vision research.

                    The "Blind Stick" project is an innovative solution designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating 
                    their surroundings with greater safety and independence. It incorporates various components, including an MSP430 
                    microcontroller, an ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer, and a Bluetooth module, to create a functional and user-friendly 
                    device. The primary function of the Blind Stick is to detect obstacles in the user's path and provide real-time 
                    feedback. Additionally, the Blind Stick integrates a Bluetooth module, enabling connectivity with a smartphone. 
                    A dedicated mobile application is developed as part of the project, allowing the blind user to establish a 
                    connection between the stick and the smartphone. Through the app, the user can access various features and functionalities.

                    The project "Connect 4" that was developed using core Java. This application was designed to provide a digital 
                    platform for users to enjoy the classic two-player game, Connect 4. The Connect 4 project offers a user-friendly 
                    interface, allowing players to download and easily engage with the game. The game follows the same logic and rules 
                    as the traditional Connect 4 game. The objective is for players to strategically drop colored discs into a vertical 
                    grid, aiming to connect four of their discs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The first player to achieve 
                    this alignment is declared the winner.

                <p>
                    The "LiFi" project is an innovative endeavor that leverages the power of light waves to transmit data wirelessly. 
                    Unlike traditional wireless communication methods that rely on radio frequency signals, LiFi utilizes light-emitting 
                    diodes (LEDs) to transmit data. The project consists of two key circuits: the transmitting circuit and the receiving 
                    circuit. The transmitting circuit is responsible for encoding the data and modulating it onto the light emitted by 
                    the LED. As the LED emits light, the encoded data is transmitted through the light waves. On the receiving end, the 
                    receiving circuit captures the light waves using a solar panel. The solar panel converts the received light signals 
                    back into electrical signals, which are then processed by the circuit. The processed data is then made available for 
                    further use, such as playback through a speaker
